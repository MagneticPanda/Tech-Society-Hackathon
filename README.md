# About the Game
We have created a game of snake with various twists.

Snake is a game where you control a snake and try to eat as many resources as possible. The snake will grow longer as you eat more apples. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself. The goal is to get the highest score possible.
The snake has 60 seconds to achieve the highest score possible.

### Type of Items

- Food item:awards a scoring point
- Apple: slows down the snake
- Pear: speeds up the snake
- Bomb: ends the game

### Leader Board
The leaderboard will display all the scores, and once your game ends, you will be promoted to enter your name to enter the history books!

### Game Over
The game will end when the snake hits, itself, or a bomb.
