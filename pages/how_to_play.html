            <h1>How to Play</h1>
            <p>Snake is a game where you control a snake and try to eat as many apples as possible. The snake will grow longer as you eat more apples. The game ends when the snake hits the wall or itself. The goal is to get the highest score possible.</p>
            <p>There are two modes of play: Classic and Time Attack. In Classic mode, you have unlimited time to eat as many apples as possible. In Time Attack mode, you have 60 seconds to eat as many apples as possible. The snake will move faster in Time Attack mode.</p>
            <p>There are also two difficulty levels: Easy and Hard. In Easy mode, the snake will move slower. In Hard mode, the snake will move faster.</p>
            <p>There are also two game modes: Single Player and Multiplayer. In Single Player mode, you play against the computer. In Multiplayer mode, you play against another player.</p>
